SalesForce Virtual Internship Project
This document details the implementation of a customized Salesforce CRM solution for
HandsMen Threads, a premium men's fashion and tailoring brand. The primary objective of this
solution was to streamline business processes, improve customer engagement, and boost sales
and marketing efforts.
The implemented solution involved designing a robust data model featuring five key custom
objects. Business processes were automated using various Salesforce features, including Record-
Triggered Flows, Scheduled Flows, Email Alerts, and Apex triggers to handle tasks such as order
processing, inventory management, and marketing campaigns. Furthermore, the solution
integrated different departments, such as sales, inventory, and marketing teams.
This end-to-end CRM implementation aims to improve customer experience through
personalized communication, enhance customer loyalty, gain real-time insights, and promote
sustainable growth on the Salesforce Platform.
